# Error handling and validation state

## We left in this state today:

    -   Order Entry form price validation (server, client side toast)
    -   Fix possible overflow errors when entering price and summing up

## What we still want to

    -   Order entry form input field max size
    -   Dismiss the toast after a few seconds (or manually by the user)
